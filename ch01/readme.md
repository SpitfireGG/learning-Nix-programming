Let-In and Basic Data Types

Welcome to the exercises for Chapter 01 of nixspin! These challenges will help you master the let-in construct and basic data types (strings, integers, floats) in Nix. Inspired by Rustlings and Ziglings, each exercise provides a broken or incomplete .nix file. Your task is to fix the code so it evaluates correctly.
