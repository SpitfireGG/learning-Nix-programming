# Chapter 5: Lazy Evaluation (a deep dive)

## Introduction

One of the defining characteristics of the Nix language is its **lazy evaluation** strategy. Unlike *eager* evaluation (found in many imperative languages) where expressions are computed as soon as they are defined, Nix delays the computation of an expression until its value is actually *required* somewhere else in the code.

This approach has several significant implications and benefits:

*   **Efficiency:** Unnecessary computations are avoided. If a variable or the result of a function call is never used, it's never computed.
*   **Defining Infinite Structures:** Laziness allows for the definition of potentially infinite data structures (like an infinite list of numbers), as only the parts actually accessed will be generated.
*   **Error Handling:** Code that might produce an error (e.g., division by zero) is safe as long as that specific code path isn't actually evaluated.
*   **Modularity:** Functions and modules can accept large configurations without paying the performance cost for options that aren't used.

## Key Concepts

*   **Evaluation on Demand:** Values are computed only when referenced. Until then, they exist as unevaluated expressions often referred to as **thunks** (a sort of placeholder or promise for a future computation).
*   **`builtins.trace`:** A crucial tool for observing laziness. Since `trace` prints a message *when its second argument is evaluated*, you can strategically place it to see the exact moment Nix decides it needs a value.
*   **Forcing Evaluation:** Sometimes, you *need* to ensure a computation happens, perhaps for its side effects (like `trace`) or before proceeding. Nix provides built-ins for this:
    *   `builtins.seq`: Takes two arguments (`a` and `b`). It forces the evaluation of `a`, discards its result, and then returns `b` (which is then evaluated only if needed later). Useful for ensuring side effects or specific computations happen *before* returning a value.
    *   `builtins.deepSeq`: Takes two arguments (`a` and `b`). It *recursively* forces the evaluation of everything inside `a` (if `a` is a list or attribute set) and then returns `b`. Useful for ensuring complex data structures are fully computed.

## Code Example

The primary concepts are demonstrated in `ch05.nix` within this directory. It shows:

*   How computations are delayed until referenced in the final attribute set.
*   Using `trace` to see evaluation order.
*   Using `seq` and `deepSeq` to force evaluation.
*   How laziness prevents errors in unused code paths.

## Exercises

To solidify your understanding, work through the exercises in this directory:

*   `ex006.nix`: Observing evaluation order with `trace`.
*   `ex007.nix`: Using `seq` and `deepSeq` to control evaluation.
*   `ex008.nix`: Laziness and conditional errors.

Refer to the main exercises `README.md` (in the parent `exercises` directory, if applicable, or follow the general instructions from Chapter 4's README if structure is flat) for guidance on running and testing the exercise files.
