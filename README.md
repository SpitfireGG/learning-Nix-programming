<div align="center">
Learning Path
</div>

focuses on practical understanding over theoretical perfection:
- Learn essential concepts with clear examples
- Build skills progressively
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Learn what you'll actually use

```nix
# Traditional documentation
recursive_learning = throw "headache";

# Our approach
learning_path = lib.foldl (acc: x -> acc + x) 0 [
  "clarity"
  "examples"
  "practicality"
];
```
