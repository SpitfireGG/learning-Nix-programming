# Learning Nix Programming üåü

A repository similar to *C_Guides* for learning the functional **Nix** programming language.

## üìù Note  

This is an attempt to create a straightforward repository compiling resources I've learned from the web. The goal is to provide sufficient material to start writing code in the Nix programming language.

While I'm not an expert in Nix, this guide may help you understand Nix code faster than the official documentation, which can be lengthy and challenging to follow.
