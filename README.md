# learning-Nix-programming
this is a repo alike the C_Guides for learning the functional nix programming language 
fix

**-Note-**
<p>This is an attempt to make a straight forward repo from the resources that i learned from the web in a way that is sufficent enough to get started writing code in the Nix programming language</p></br>
<p>Although i am not an expert at this language, this is just for learning and might help you understand the nix code much faster as the official nix documentation is quiet long and challenging to follow along</p>
