** the following is a great explaination i found when at first i wanted to know about the   `mkFunctions` **

### For example, you could have a module a.nix that sets services.nginx.enable = X; and another module b.nix that sets services.nginx.enable = Y;. But X is not necessarily equal to Y, causing a conflict in your configuration: should nginx be enabled or not?                                       To solve this, NixOS introduced a couple of functions to assign a “priority” to a value for some option. The most primitive function to do this is mkOverride 679 (the link to the function’s definition doesn’t help a whole lot here in understanding the inner workings because its implementation does not really reveal any of its effects). mkOverride accepts two arguments: a priority (which is a number) and a value. When NixOS detects a conflict in your configuration, it uses the priority to determine which value to prefer; lower priority values are preferred over higher ones.
